            I recently earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from UNC Charlotte in May 2025, graduating with a 4.00 GPA.
            I also earned my bachelor's degree in May 2024 with a 3.96 GPA and was named to the Chancellor's List for five consecutive semesters from Fall 2021 to Fall 2023. 
            Through academic coursework and personal projects, I have built responsive, scalable web applications using React.js and Express.js, while working in Agile team environments. 
            I am open to internships and full-time job opportunities where I can contribute in a team towards building applications that arenâ€™t just functional, but intuitive and maintainable.

            I have achieved a 4th degree black belt in Taekwondo after dedicating my life to it since I was 5 years old. 
            Taekwondo helped me develop not only my physical skills, but also mental qualities like respect, discipline, focus, and perseverance. 
            I've been working part-time as an instructor since I was 15 years old, leading classes of students, teaching proper Taekwondo technique, and serving as a role model. 
            Instructing Taekwondo has strengthened my leadership, responsibility, public speaking, and confidence, which are skills that apply to the real world. 
            Taekwondo has shaped who I am today, and I know the lessons I learned will continue to guide me in the future.

                I've been a competitive speedcuber since 2017, a sport where twisty puzzles are solved as fast as possible. 
                My main event is solving the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube one-handed where I am ranked top 100 globally with a 7.32-second single solve and 10.35-second average of 5 solves.
                I am the 4-time Southeast US Champion in this event, as well as a finalist at the 2025 World Championship, 2024 North American Championship, and 2023 US National Championship. 
                I am also passionate about giving back to the community by volunteering at over 50 competitions and co-organizing 3 competitions at UNC Charlotte. 
                My ultimate goal is to achieve an official sub-10 second one-handed average of 5 solves.
